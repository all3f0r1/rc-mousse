  **Design Movement**: Industrial Brutalism meets Swiss Style
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Raw & Refined**: Juxtaposition of raw industrial textures (concrete, metal) with refined, precise typography.
  2. **Function First**: Layouts that prioritize information hierarchy and service clarity, mimicking the precision of foam cutting.
  3. **Grid Precision**: Strict grid systems that reflect the mathematical precision of custom cutting.
  4. **Tactile Digital**: Use of textures and shadows to evoke the physical sensation of foam and fabric.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Industrial Greys**: A range of cool greys (concrete, steel) as the foundation, representing the machinery and workshop.
  - **Safety Yellow**: A vibrant, high-visibility yellow (derived from the logo) used sparingly for CTAs and critical information, symbolizing safety and attention.
  - **Deep Blue**: A dark, trustworthy blue (also from logo) for primary text and headers, grounding the design.
  - **Foam Accents**: Soft pastel accents (mint, pale pink) representing the foam products themselves, providing contrast to the industrial base.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Asymmetric Grid**: A modular, bento-box style layout that breaks the monotony of standard columns.
  - **Split Screens**: Vertical split screens to contrast process (machinery) with product (finished cushions).
  - **Sticky Navigation**: A robust, side-aligned or sticky top navigation that feels like a control panel.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Technical Lines**: Thin, technical drawing lines and measurements as decorative elements.
  - **Cut Corners**: Buttons and cards with 45-degree cut corners, mimicking foam cutting.
  - **Monospace Data**: Use of monospace fonts for dimensions, prices, and technical specs.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Mechanical Precision**: Hover effects that are instant and snappy, not soft.
  - **Reveal on Hover**: Technical details revealing themselves when interacting with product images.

  **Animation**:
  - **Slide & Slice**: Content entering with sharp, sliding motions, like a blade cutting through material.
  - **Staggered Reveal**: Grid items loading in a staggered sequence.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: 'Space Grotesk' or 'Chakra Petch' for a technical, industrial feel.
  - **Body**: 'Inter' or 'Roboto' for maximum legibility.
  - **Data**: 'JetBrains Mono' or 'Fira Code' for dimensions and pricing.

  **Design Movement**: Soft Modernism / Neumorphism 2.0
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Softness & Comfort**: The design should physically feel like the product (foam, cushions) - soft, yielding, comfortable.
  2. **Organic Shapes**: Avoiding sharp corners in favor of rounded, organic forms that mimic foam under pressure.
  3. **Light & Shadow**: Heavy use of soft shadows and lighting to create depth and volume, making elements look "squeezable".
  4. **Clean & Airy**: Extensive whitespace to convey cleanliness and precision in manufacturing.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Cloud White**: Warm off-whites and light greys as the primary background to let the colorful products pop.
  - **Soft Blue**: A calming, trustworthy blue for branding, softer than the industrial standard.
  - **Warm Accent**: A soft, warm orange/yellow for warmth and invitation.
  - **Textile Textures**: Subtle background patterns resembling fabric weaves.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Fluid Container**: Content flows centrally with wide margins, feeling unconstrained.
  - **Overlapping Layers**: Elements slightly overlapping to create a sense of depth and layering (like stacked cushions).
  - **Card-Based**: Information grouped in soft, pillowy cards.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Pill Shapes**: Buttons and tags are fully rounded pills.
  - **Soft Shadows**: Deep, diffused shadows that lift elements off the page.
  - **Gradient Overlays**: Subtle gradients on images to integrate them softly into the background.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Squishy Feedback**: Buttons that scale down slightly ("squish") when clicked.
  - **Smooth Scroll**: Buttery smooth scrolling experience.

  **Animation**:
  - **Float & Bob**: Subtle floating animations for hero elements.
  - **Fade & Scale**: Elements gently fading in and scaling up.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: 'Outfit' or 'Plus Jakarta Sans' - geometric but friendly and rounded.
  - **Body**: 'DM Sans' or 'Quicksand' for approachability.

  **Design Movement**: Bauhaus Functionalism
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Form Follows Function**: Every element has a purpose; decoration is minimal but impactful.
  2. **Geometric Purity**: Use of primary shapes (circles, squares, triangles) derived from foam cutting shapes.
  3. **Bold Contrast**: High contrast between typography and background for readability.
  4. **Material Honesty**: Showcasing the raw materials (foam blocks) as art objects.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Primary Triad**: Using the primary colors (Blue, Red, Yellow) often found in foam density coding, but with a modern, slightly desaturated twist.
  - **Stark Black & White**: High contrast base for text and layout structure.
  - **Kraft Paper**: A subtle beige/cardboard tone for secondary backgrounds, referencing packaging and templates.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Modular Grid**: A strict, visible grid system where content blocks fit together like Tetris pieces (or foam cuts).
  - **Typographic Scale**: Massive headings used as structural elements.
  - **Asymmetric Balance**: Balancing large blocks of color with negative space.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Geometric Masks**: Images masked into circles or triangles.
  - **Thick Borders**: Heavy strokes defining sections and buttons.
  - **Color Blocking**: Large areas of solid color to define sections.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Direct & Bold**: Interactions are obvious and high-contrast (e.g., black button turns yellow on hover).
  - **Cursor Effects**: A custom cursor that changes shape over interactive elements.

  **Animation**:
  - **Constructivist Motion**: Elements sliding in from cardinal directions to "assemble" the page.
  - **Color Shifts**: Background colors changing abruptly between sections.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: 'Archivo Black' or 'Syne' for bold, geometric impact.
  - **Body**: 'Public Sans' or 'Manrope' for neutral clarity.
